# RuntimeException

## Description:

Implement a method that takes two integer arrays as arguments and returns a new array, each element of which is equal to a quotient of the elements of the two incoming arrays in the same cell. If the lengths of the arrays are not equal, you need to notify the user. When executing the method, the only exception the user may see is your `RuntimeException`.
