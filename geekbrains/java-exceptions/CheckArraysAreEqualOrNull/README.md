# Check arrays are equal or null

## Description:

Implement a method that takes two integer arrays as arguments and returns a new array. Each element of the new array must be equal to the difference of the elements of the two incoming arrays in the same cell. If the lengths of the arrays are not equal, you must inform the user about it. It is worth considering that instead of an array may come `null`, which must be processed.
