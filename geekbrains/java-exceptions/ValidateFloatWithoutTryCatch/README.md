# Validate float number without try catch block

## Description:

Implement a method that asks the user to enter a floating point number, and returns the entered value. Entering text instead of a number should not cause the application to crash. Instead, the user should be asked to re-enter the floating point number. Write a regular expression and use the `matches` method. Don't use `try-catch` block.
