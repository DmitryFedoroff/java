# 3x3 grid state serializer

### Description:

Assume that the numbers in an initial array of `9` elements range from `[0, 3]`. For instance, these numbers could represent the states of cells in a `3x3` grid, where `0` denotes an empty cell, `1` represents a certain condition, `2` indicates a different condition, and `3` serves as a reserved value. This assumption allows the entire `3x3` grid to be stored in a single `int` variable. Write these `9` values into a file such that they only occupy three bytes.
