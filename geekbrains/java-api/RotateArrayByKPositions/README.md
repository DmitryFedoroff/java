# Rotate array by k positions

## Description:

Write a program to rotate an array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative and denotes position shift.

## Example:

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], k = 3
Output: [13, 14, 15, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```
