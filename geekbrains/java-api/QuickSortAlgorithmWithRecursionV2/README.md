# Sort array with quick sort algorithm using recursion

## Description:

Write a program to sort an array with a quick sort algorithm using recursion. Optimize the partitioning process of the Quick Sort algorithm using a random pivot.

## Note:

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer paradigm. In this algorithm the array is divided into two sub-lists, one sub-list will contain the smaller elements and another sub-list will contain the larger elements and then these sub-lists are sorted again using recursion.

## Example:

```
Input: [-2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, -4, -8, -9, -10]
Output: [-10, -9, -8, -4, -2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8]
```
