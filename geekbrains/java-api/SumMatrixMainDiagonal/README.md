# Find sum of matrix main diagonal

## Description:

Write a program to calculate the sum of all the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix.

## Note:

The main diagonal contains an element from each row of the matrix. For example, the first element from the first row, second element from the second row, and so on. The first element of the first row and the last element of the last row can be connected by a straight path.

## Example:

```
Input:
4  7  2	
5  10 6	
10 10 1	
4  7  2

Output: 15
```
