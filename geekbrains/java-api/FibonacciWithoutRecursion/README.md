# Fibonacci sequence without recursion

## Description:

Print first `n` Fibonacci numbers without using recursion method. The first two numbers of Fibonacci series are `0` and `1`.

## Note:

Recursive solution may involve heavy use of the limited resources of the computer because they involve a potentially large number of function calls. True iterative solution is always better than recursive one and implemented using a looping construct.

## Examples:

```
Input: 4
Output: 0 1 1 2
```
```
Input: 7
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```
```
Input: 10
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
