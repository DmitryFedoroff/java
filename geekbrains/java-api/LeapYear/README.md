# Leap Year

### Description:

Write a program to check whether the year is leap year and returns a boolean (leap `true`, not leap `false`).

### Note:

Every `4th` year is a leap year, except every `100th` year, with every `400th` year being a leap year.

It follows that any year evenly divisible by four is a leap year, except for centile years (years ending with two zeros), which are considered normal years and therefore have typical `365` days, unless they are evenly divisible by `400`. Therefore, `1600` and `2000` years are leap years, while `1700`, `1800`, `1900` and `2100` are not.

### Examples:

```
Input: 1704
Output: true
```
```
Input: 2000
Output: true
```
```
Input: 2020
Output: true
```
```
Input: 2100
Output: false
```
