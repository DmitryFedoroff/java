# Sort array in wave form

## Description:

Write a program to sort an array of integers in such a way that the numbers in the array are arranged in a wave form.

## Note:

An array is in wave form when `array[0] >= array[1] <= array[2] >= array[3] <= array[4] >= ...` and if we will form a graph it will be in an up-down fashion rather than a straight line.

## Example:

```
Input: [7, 9, 1, 4, -9, -9, 0, 6, 6, -2]
Output: [9, 1, 7, -9, 4, -9, 6, 0, 6, -2]
```
