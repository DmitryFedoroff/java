# Sort array with quick sort algorithm using recursion

## Description:

Write a program to sort an array with a quick sort algorithm using recursion. Implement the quick sort that uses the rightmost element as the pivot.

## Note:

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer paradigm. In this algorithm the array is divided into two sub-lists, one sub-list will contain the smaller elements and another sub-list will contain the larger elements and then these sub-lists are sorted again using recursion.

## Example:

```
Input: [7, -7, -6, 6, 1, -5, 3, 8, -2, -7]
Output: [-7, -7, -6, -5, -2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8]
```
