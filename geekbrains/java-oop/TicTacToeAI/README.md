# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Development with AI Integration

## Description:

For this assignment, you are tasked with creating a console-based application in Java that simulates the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, with a twist: one of the players will be controlled by an AI.

The game will require the following features:

__Game Configuration__: Upon starting the game, the user should be prompted to enter the dimensions of the game board (i.e., number of rows and columns). In addition, they should specify the required number of marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.

__Player Turns__: The game should support two types of players: a human player and an AI player. The human player should be prompted to enter the coordinates where they would like to place their mark `X`, and these coordinates should be validated. For the AI player `O`, your code should intelligently decide the best spot to place its mark.

__Win Condition Verification__: After each move, your game should check whether either player has won by getting the required number of their marks in a row in any direction. If the game is won, it should declare the winner and end the game.

__Game Replay__: After the end of a game, users should be asked if they would like to play another round. If they agree, the game should reset and start again.

Your Java application should be well-structured and organized, with logical divisions into packages, classes, and methods. Your code should be clean, commented, and adhere to good coding practices.

This assignment will allow you to apply and demonstrate your understanding of Java programming, object-oriented design principles, and AI implementation in game development.
