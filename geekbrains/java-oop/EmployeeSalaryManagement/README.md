# Employee Salary Management System

## Description:

The task is to create three classes (base and two derived), representing different employees who either have an hourly wage or a fixed salary.

- Describe an abstract method in the base class to calculate the average monthly salary.

- For hourly-paid employees, the formula for calculating it is: `average monthly salary = 20.8 * 8 * hourly wage` and for employees with fixed salary: `average monthly salary = fixed monthly salary`

- On the base of the abstract class, create an array of employees and populate it.

- Implement interfaces for sorting the array (pay attention to the `Comparator` and `Comparable` interfaces).

- Create a class that contains an array of employees, and implement the ability to output data using `foreach`.
